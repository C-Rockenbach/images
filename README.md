# images
This is a place for me to publish/share my artwork. I started it because I couldn't find any decent vector images of a leaf-cutter ant for a paper figure I was creating. So I made my own and want to share it so others can use it.

I'm licensing all the artwork in this repository with the Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International CC License (see License file for details).
